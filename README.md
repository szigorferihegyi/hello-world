re-start the github journey

Learnt a bit about GitHub once upon a time, but it's all gone.
Need to re-learn and use it for all the things I do.
Recepies, diary, notes, code repository, conspiracy and revenge plans... 
(not really, but like to cook, find the concept of revenge ridiculous, 
and if I ever conspired, why on earth would use GitHub to store anything about the plans...)
